# Apriori-and-MS-Apriori-to-find-the-K-frequent-itemsets
The project finds the K-frequent itemsets using both Apriori and MS-Apriori. For apriori, the package MLXTend has been used while the MS-Apriori algorithm has been implemented from scratch based on the algorithm provided in the book Web Data Mining by Bing Liu.
