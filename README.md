# Apriori-and-MS-Apriori-to-find-the-K-frequent-itemsets
The project finds the K-frequent itemsets using both Apriori and MS-Apriori. For apriori, the package MLXTend has been used while the MS-Apriori algorithm has been implemented from scratch based on the algorithm provided in the book Web Data Mining by Bing Liu.

The dataset used is the "Bag of Words" dataset found publicly in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words)

The dataset name, the value of "K" and the minimum frequency for the item to be considered(supp_count) are to be passed as input parameters to both the codes.

This was an assignment for the course "Data Mining and Machine Learning" at CMI. The outputs I obtained are also provided.
